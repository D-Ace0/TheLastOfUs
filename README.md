# TheLastOfUs

The project was about an exercise on the concepts of OOP
Note: The Backend is fine and works properly. but, Frontend is not fully implemented as i had little experience at this stage
Note: The Main.java file is the one you can run to test the Game
###### Update: Unfortunately, the Frontend code got deleted by mistake and the v1 of the front end is used instead here.
Note: buttons works with pressing space in the keyboard not with mouse due to the use of Stackpane.
