# TheLastOfUs - v2

The project was an exercise on the concepts of OOP.

**Note:**
- The Backend is fine and works properly.
- The Frontend is not fully implemented as I had little experience at this stage.
- The `Main.java` file is the one you can run to test the game.

**Update:**
Unfortunately, some of the Front End code (which exists in v2) that links the backend's logic and functions of the game has been lost due to a ransomware attack before pushing it to the repo. But no worries, the game works fine. Just some modifications to link the UI with the rest of the logic are needed. (85-90%) is already done.

**Note:**
- Buttons work with pressing space on the keyboard, not with the mouse, due to the use of `StackPane`.
